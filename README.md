 # Degan Gaming Project

This repository is for the project assessment of the project of the 4th module of : solidity-avax-intermediate course of Metacrafters academy . The purpose of creating this to prove my learning and to showcase my skill as a solidity developer to the people.

# Problem Statement
## Description
Are you up for a challenge that will put your skills to the test? Degen Gaming 🎮, a renowned game studio, has approached you to create a unique token that can reward players and take their game to the next level. You have been tasked with creating a token that can be earned by players in their game and then exchanged for rewards in their in-game store. A smart step towards increasing player loyalty and retention 🧠

To support their ambitious plans, Degen Gaming has selected the Avalanche blockchain, a leading blockchain platform for web3 gaming projects, to create a fast and low-fee token. With these tokens, players can not only purchase items in the store, but also trade them with other players, providing endless possibilities for growth📈

Are you ready to join forces with Degen Gaming and help turn their vision into a reality? The gaming world is counting on you to take it to the next level. Will you rise to the challenge 💪, or will it be game over ☠️ for you?

## Challenge
Your task is to create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:

Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.
Solution Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has different functions that connnects our metacrafter wallet which is set on Avalnche fuji C-Chain testnet and can see all the transaction at: https://testnet.snowtrace.io and contract is deployed using Remix IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/ with this smart contract all the above given are geing performed.

It's essential to connect the metamask wallet with Avalanche Fuji C-Chain Testnet and to add view transaction to: https://testnet.snowtrace.io to check the transaction on the block viewer of Avalance Platform.

## Getting Started
## Executing Program
Open Remix IDE and create the Smart Contract named " DegenToken.sol " and paste the smart contract code to it.
Connect Metamask to the Remix IDE with the testnet account having AVAX token for the gas fee.
Deploy the contract using " Avalanche Fuji C-Chain " account.
Copy the Deployed contract address and go to https://testnet.snowtrace.io
Search the coppied address in the search box it will show all the transaction blocks of that smart contract.
Check All the functionality of my smart contract.
